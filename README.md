# Week 7: Advanced Automation and Integration

This repository contains my Week 7 tasks from the Python Selenium Learning Journey, focusing on advanced automation practices, including cross-browser compatibility, headless browsing, and cloud-based testing using BrowserStack.

---

## Tasks and Highlights

### **Task 1: Cross-Browser Testing**
- Configured the framework to accept browser names via a configuration file.  
- Integrated WebDriverManager for seamless browser driver management.  
- Validated test scripts on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.  

### **Task 2: Headless Browser Testing**
- Enabled headless execution for Chrome and Firefox for faster test runs.  
- Verified test accuracy and compared execution times with non-headless mode.  

### **Task 3: BrowserStack Integration**
- Connected the Selenium framework to BrowserStack for cloud-based testing.  
- Executed test cases across multiple browser versions and operating systems.  
- Analyzed detailed reports for cross-platform compatibility.

## Key Learnings
- Enhanced framework flexibility for cross-browser testing.  
- Improved execution efficiency with headless browsing.  
- Gained expertise in cloud-based test execution using BrowserStack.

## How to Run the Scripts
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Update Configurations**:  
   - Specify browser, headless mode and BrowserStack credentials in the `config.json` and `browserstack_config.json` file.

4. **Run Tests**:  
   ```bash
   pytest test_cases/<required test to be performed> --html=reports/report.html
   ```
